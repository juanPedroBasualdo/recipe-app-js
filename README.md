# 🥧 recipe-app-js

<div text-align="justify">

Recipe searching app developed via React framework fetching information from the Spoonacular API in order to get the recipes. 

### ℹ️ About this proyect.

I developed this webpage in order to practice JavaScript and HTML. The idea was to create a simple app so I could dip my toes in app-making whilst I'm in the university. The main use this app will get is to search for inspiration whenever I don't know what to cook to my gf tbh. Regardless it was a nice and fun proyect that I'll be revisiting in the future to add more features.

### ⚙️ Features.

- Search for recipes by name or ingredient
- Fetch ingredients, steps and characteristics of a given recipe.

### 🕒 To be added in the future.
